                On November 6th, our Team No 27, consisting of four members, taught 5th graders how to code at the "Hour of Code" event using studio.code.org and the "blocking" technique. 
                The students at School No. 23 were excited to learn, but they varied in their levels of activity. Some were experienced and caught on quickly, while others took more time or were shy.
                However, we made sure everyone had a chance to participate and complete levels. Some students even teamed up to help each other. 
                <br>During the session, the kids showed interest in ADA University and asked about computer science, our favorite courses, and lecture times.</br>
                In the 45 minutes, the students successfully completed 20 coding questions, and we rewarded them with certificates. Some students were curious about game-building, so we provided additional websites for inspiration.
                Overall, teaching the younger generation was a rewarding experience. 
                <br>Their enthusiasm to learn highlighted the potential in both their future and ours. It was a joy to see their achievements.</br>
